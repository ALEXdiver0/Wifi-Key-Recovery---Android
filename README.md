Wifi Key Recovery - Android========================** You need root to use this application. **Have you ever forgotten the password of your home WiFi network, or the one you set-up for your parents a few months back?This application will help you recover the password of a wireless network you have connected to with your device in the past.You can then either tap on an entry to copy it, or export the list to SD, or share it using the standard Android sharing facilities.It does not crack the network, or use the MAC/SSID address to deduce the password. It simply reads it from the device itself. You need to have connected to the network in the past as it essentially it parses the wpa_supplicant file.For more information on how the keys are recovered read here:[http://alt236.blogspot.com/2011/04/android-wifi-password-locations.html]()Notes-----------* You need root to use this application.* You need to have connected to the network in the past.* This app cannot "hack" into an unknown/new network.* I cannot help you with getting root.
